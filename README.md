The Siddhi Resort Project is a web-based platform designed to enhance both guest and staff experiences through an interactive website and efficient management system. The platform allows users to easily browse resort details, check room availability, and make bookings online. Additionally, it streamlines backend operations for staff, enabling them to manage reservations, customer data, and resort resources effectively.
Built using modern web technologies, the frontend is developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a responsive and dynamic user interface that works seamlessly across various devices. On the backend, the platform utilizes Flask, a Python web framework, to handle server-side logic and manage data processing. MySQL serves as the database, securely storing guest information, booking records, and room availability. Together, these technologies provide a robust, scalable solution that enhances the overall user experience while simplifying the resortâ€™s operational processes.
